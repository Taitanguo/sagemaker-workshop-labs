# Machine Learning Workshop

## Prerequisites
Setup Amazon SageMaker Studio and clone GitHub repository 

- Step 1: Login into the AWS console, navigate to Amazon SageMaker service 

- Step 2: Create Amazon SageMaker Studio Session in Oregon (us-west-2) region. Open it. 

- Step 3: Clone GitHub repository within the Amazon SageMaker Studio. GitHub repo: https://github.com/veerathp/sagemaker-workshop-labs
   
   To clone, go to the Fileâ†’Terminal and then copy the command below
   ```
  git clone https://github.com/veerathp/sagemaker-workshop-labs.git
   ```
## Hands-on labs

Use **Phyton 3 (Data Science)** kernel to run all labs below

### Lab 1: Build, Train and Deploy ML models
Build, Train and Deploy Machine Learning models using Amazon SageMaker / DeerAR

- Open and run the Notebook Instances in Amazon SageMaker Studio located in `/01-01-DeepAR/deepar_chicago_traffic_violations.ipynb`

### Lab 2: Hyper Parameter Optimization
Hyper Parameter Optimization using Amazon SageMaker. The first lab will take about 20-30mins to run, once completed move to the second notebook to analyzing the training jobs.

- Open and run the Notebook Instances in Amazon SageMaker Studio located in `/02-sagemaker-hpo-xgboost/hpo_xgboost_direct_marketing_sagemaker_python_sdk.ipynb`

- Cont. Open and run the Notebook Instances in Amazon SageMaker Studio located in `/02-sagemaker-hpo-xgboost/HPO_Analyze_TuningJob_Results.ipynb`. Make sure you replace the name of the training job



### Lab 3: Model monitoring 
Monitoring Machine Learning endpoints 
- Open and run the Notebook Instance in Amazon SageMaker Studio located in `/03-sagemaker-model-monitor/SageMaker-ModelMonitoring.ipynb`


### Lab 4: Multi Model endpoints
